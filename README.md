# OpenLWeb

**OpenLWeb** (**Open Source Local Web**) is a visual, interactive tool for managing the articles, papers, and blogs you read, all stored locally, fully under your control.  

Traditional bookmarking tools quickly become cluttered, and while tools like Notion are powerful, they often lack the **spatial, graph-based** approach needed to truly see the relationships between what you read. OpenLWeb was built to solve that.


## Why Local?
OpenLWeb was built on the idea that your reading history is personal knowledge and it should stay yours. By keeping everything local and open source, you retain:

Privacy â€” No data leaks or shadow profiles.

Portability â€” Move your database anywhere, anytime.

Hackability â€” Modify the source to fit your workflow.



## âœ¨ Features

- **Local-first** â€” Your data stays on your machine. No accounts, no tracking, no external servers.
- **Graph view** â€” See your articles, papers, and tags as a connected network.
- **Tag trees** â€” Navigate your reading material through a clean, collapsible tag hierarchy.
- **Search & filter** â€” Quickly find what you need without losing context.
- **Custom metadata** â€” Store extra details like author, publication date, and category.
- **Responsive UI** â€” Works smoothly on desktop browsers.
